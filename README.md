These are the codes for the paper "Deep Affix Features Improve Neural Named Entity Recognizers" (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-2021)

Please email the first author for any further details.

There is also an explanatory follow up paper which covers broader domains and was published at COLING 2018 - "A Survey on Recent Advances in Named Entity Recognition from Deep Learning models" (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1182)
